            "explanation": "A Web Application is the top-level logical unit, created in Central Administration, which maps to an IIS website and is associated with content databases and authentication providers. For example, a farm might have two Web Applications: one for internal intranet (HTTP) and another for internet-facing extranet (HTTPS), each with different databases and authentication methods."

            "explanation": "Features are the fundamental unit of deployment in classic SharePoint, allowing for modular activation of functionality at the Farm, WebApplication, Site (Collection), or Web (Site) scope.

            "explanation": "Content Types allow you to define a schema (via Site Columns) and a template (e.g., a .dotx for a 'Contract' content type) that can be reused across multiple lists and libraries. Practical example: A 'Purchase Order' content type includes fields like Vendor, Amount, ApprovalDate, and a .docx template; when users upload a PO, SharePoint enforces these fields and provides the template format."

Each Site Collection has a top-level Site (SPWeb) and can have many subsites (SPWebs). Real scenario: Farm > Intranet Web App > HR Site Collection > HR Root Site > Payroll Subsite.

            "correctAnswer": "A way to reference connections (like SharePoint, SQL, Outlook) once and reuse them across multiple flows, simplifying governance.",
            "explanation": "Connection References improve governance. Instead of each flow having its own SQL connection, create a shared connection reference. If credentials change, update once. All flows automatically use the new credentials. This prevents scattered, hard-to-maintain connections."

            "explanation": "Lazy loading speeds up page load. Scenario: A web part has 3 tabs. Load only the active tab's data initially. When users click 'Tab 2', load that data. Initial page load is fast; data loads as needed. This improves perceived performance significantly."

            "explanation": "Tree shaking reduces bundle size. Example: You import a library with 100 functions but use only 5. Tree shaking removes the 95 unused functions from the final bundle. If the bundle was 500KB, it might become 50KB. Users download 10x less, faster page load."
